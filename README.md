A code dump for the project I led on the epigenomic nature of Double-Strand Breaks at Common Fragile Sites. This exciting work elucidates the underlying nature of chromosomal fragility and provides a better, working molecular model for the occurence of Common Fragile Sites in the human genome. Our work may lead to a better understanding of the etiological basis of multiple neurological disorders & cancers. Part of my research at the SUNY Upstate Feng Lab. This repository includes portions of the data preprocessing, feature analysis, and random forest prediction tools. See below.
